          <p>I am highlyâ€“motivated, hard-working and enthusiastic about engineer and energy with an appropriate education background about petroleum engineering. I decided to switch career to become a <span>Full Stack Developer</span> because I am interested in creating a web. I like mathematical and logical things so I decided to study about web developer in <span>ZettaCamp</span>.</p>
          <p>Listening to <span>Music</span> has always been my go to activity for all occasions. My love for music can be traced back to when I was a child. There are recorded videos of me as a child becoming hyperactive whenever music was played. I would run to <span>the stereo</span>, turn on the music to full volume and start running around dancing. Anyone who dared touch the sound system would face my wrath. Music was the only thing that could calm me down whenever I cried.</p>
